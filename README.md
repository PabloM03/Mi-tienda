# Mi Tienda Static Site

This repository contains a static mirror of the "Mi Tienda" storefront. The goal is to convert this static HTML site into a functional Shopify theme so it can be installed on a Shopify store and take advantage of Shopify's commerce features while maintaining the existing design.

For details on how to package the theme and upload it to your store, see [theme/README.md](theme/README.md).
