# Shopify Theme

This directory provides a minimal Shopify theme generated from the static HTML.

To use it:
1. Zip the `theme` directory contents.
2. Upload the zip file in your Shopify admin as a new theme.

The layout now uses separate header and footer sections and simple templates for
products, collections, blogs, and pages.
