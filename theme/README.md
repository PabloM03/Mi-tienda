# Shopify Theme

This directory packages the static site as a lightweight Shopify theme.

## Usage
1. Zip the contents of the `theme` folder.
2. Upload the zip in your Shopify admin to add the theme.

The theme includes a basic layout with header and footer sections. The homepage uses two dynamic sections:
- **Hero**: customizable title, text, background image and optional button.
- **Featured collection**: choose a collection and number of products to display.

Templates exist for products, collections, blogs, pages, cart and search.

Additional templates are provided under `templates/customers` for customer login, registration and account pages. These give the theme basic customer account functionality out of the box.
